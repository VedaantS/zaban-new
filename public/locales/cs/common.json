Audio recordings are generated using <1>Azure Cognitive Services</1> and then checked by native speakers. Where computer synthesis shows flaws, we try to solve them. In some cases it is complicated and sometimes even impossible. Weaker support for Hindi in Azure Cognitive Services causes occasional misaccent and pronunciation of the Hindi consonant <i>\"g\"</i> as <i>\"h\"</i>. We are aware of this issue and are working on a solution. If it still happens, that you come across a bug (or suspect you've discovered a bug), contact us using our 'Found a bug or have a suggestion for improvement?' form at the bottom of our site. You too can contribute to improving Movapp. Thank you!"
