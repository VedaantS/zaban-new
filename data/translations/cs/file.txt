Grandpa asked grandma to bake a donut.
Grandma found flour, mixed the dough and baked a donut.
She took it out of the oven and placed it on the window to cool.
The donut lay and lay on the window, and then he jumped down and rolled down the path.
He's rolling down the path when a bunny is standing in front of him. And the bunny says says he will eat the donut.
The donut asked the bunny not to eat him and instead sang him a song and ran away.
The donut rolls along the path when a wolf stands in front of it. And he also says that he will eat him.
Donut begged the wolf not to eat him and offered to sing him a song.
The wolf agreed and the donut, while singing his song, ran away.
The donut rolls along the path when a bear stands in front of it. And also promises to eat him.
But the donut asked the bear not to eat it and instead listen to a song about the donut's adventure.
And again, while the donut was singing, he managed to escape the bear.
And so the donut continued to roll down the path when a fox stood in front of it. She wants to enjoy a donut too.
But the donut again - he begs her not to eat it and listen to a song instead.
The fox agreed, so the donut started singing again.
But when the song was over, the fox asked him to sing again the beautiful song that she liked so much.
But she complained that she couldn't hear, and asked the donut to sit on her tongue so she could hear him better.
Donut happily jumped on the fox's tongue and began to sing...
And the fox ate him!
